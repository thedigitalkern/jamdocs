This Documentation Guide is intended that you have basic knowledge of how a computer works with basic knowledge of [Operating System - Windows by Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/get-windows-10 "Operating System - Windows by Microsoft")®, [Microsoft](https://www.britannica.com/technology/MS-DOS "Microsoft Disk Operating System or MS-DOS")®[ Disk Operating System or MS-DOS](https://www.britannica.com/technology/MS-DOS "Microsoft Disk Operating System or MS-DOS") or [Windows Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7 "Windows Powershell") Commands required ([.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework ".NET Framework")), an active internet connection with a substantial amount of bandwidth provided by your choice of Internet Service Provider or ISP, latest drivers pre-installed with your workstation provided by the Manufacturer or use [DriversCloud.com](https://www.driverscloud.com/ "DriversCloud.com") for fetching drivers automatically from digitally signed manufacturer websites or via third party sources offered at DriversCloud.com.

## Download Official Microsoft Windows Operating System

To get started, you will first need to **have a license to install Windows 10**. If you don't have a license to install Windows 10 and have not yet previously upgraded to it, you can [Purchase via Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10 "Purchase via Microsoft").

**Note:** If you previously upgraded to Windows 10 on this PC and you’re reinstalling it, you don’t need to enter a product key. Your copy of Windows 10 will automatically activate later using your digital license.

You can then download and run the media creation tool. For more information on how to use the tool, see the instructions on the [Official Microsoft Media Creation Tools Download Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10 " Official Microsoft Media Creation Tools Download Page")

You can do the following -

* Make sure to keep all installation files for software that you have installed on your existing machine that you are planning to upgrade or regularly use with their individual license keys. Make sure to backup your digital content on cloud storage or external devices such as USB sticks or SSD drives.
* **Create Windows 10 installation media**
  * Using the tool to create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) to **install Windows 10 on a different PC**.
  * Using the tool to **upgrade your current PC to Windows 10**.
  * Using the installation media you created **for other** [**Microsoft devices** such as Surface Pro](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/compare-devices "Buy Microsoft devices such as Surface Pro"). Download [drivers for Surface](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware "Download drivers and firmware for Surface") devices.
* [Sign in to the Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx "Sign in to the Volume Licensing Service Center  to download Enterprise editions")
* [Sign in to your subscription on the MSDN Portal for MSDN](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads "Sign in to your subscription on the MSDN Portal for MSDN downloads")

* [Visit the Download Academic Products page for Education editions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/vlacademicwindows10 "Visit the Download Academic Products page for Education editions") (product key required)

Once the OS + drivers are installed with your set of required licensed software, you can scan the backed-up content on another system or freshly installed system with the Anti-Virus / Anti-Malware Software and begin the transfer of files.

You can also create another set of USB Stick containing [Rootkit Hunter via ESET](https://www.eset.com/in/download-utilities/ "Download ESET Tools and Utilities") and scan your existing system for fixing any malware or virus related issues.

[Recovery options in Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415 "Recovery options in Windows 10 - If you're having problems with your PC, the following table can help you decide which recovery option to use.") - If you're having problems with your PC, the following table can help you decide which recovery option to use.

## System Restore to Factory Settings

Fresh installation can be performed via the above methods or via System Restore to Factory Settings - Keep existing data or Fresh install via erasing all user-created files and applications.

## Updating Official Drivers, System Restore Point via Windows 10 and System Rescue Disk via ESET

The reason I recommend DriversCloud.com is because it allows the user to set a [System Restore Point](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point "System Restore Point") on your existing Operating System prior to making any changes to the system drivers. You can always opt-out of the "change your default browser or allow it to add any further extensions to your browser apart from what is recommended upon setup. It is strongly advised that you as a user check that you are running the latest version of [Windows 10 Pro N (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-is/p/windows-10-pro-n/dg7gmgf0dt06 "Windows 10 Pro N") that gives you access to approximately 85% of Random Access Memory or RAM. Also, I find this resource quite useful on [How to Find Windows 10 Computer Specifications & Systems Requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/windows-10-specifications "How to Find Windows 10 Computer Specifications & Systems Requirements") before opting in to upgrading your existing Operating System and resolve any clarifications of whether your existing Hardware Components can or will support the upgrade. Create a [System Rescue Disk via ESET](System Rescue Disk via ESET "System Rescue Disk via ESET").

## Future-Proofing does not only mean spending more, think of it more like an investment (*subject to market risks)

You as a user need to keep in mind that choosing the right hardware is quite important - [Future Proofing Hardware](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/future-proof-computer.htm "Future Proofing Hardware") - It is not always important to purchase the highest monetary value sorted in your search fields - You need to ask yourself this - Do I need this quality hardware/software update or upgrade consider it will solve the need or the purpose you intend to use it for? But having said that you'd need to keep in mind that investing in newer hardware technologies/software components/webservers/hard disk drives and other multiverse components will affect your system performance, in turn, your productivity. A simple check can be made via [Samsung's Official Website - Why it is important for you to invest in the latest Solid State Drives](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/pc-age-calculator/ "PC Age Calculator") as compared to older [Serial Advanced Technology Attachment or SATA](https://www.britannica.com/technology/SATA "Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA))") / NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) / Hard Disk Drives that perform at lower IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) or Read/Write Speeds during data transfer. You can view an excellent infographic by ©2020 Kingston Technology Europe Co LLP that compares [Traditional to Modern / Future Proof Storage solutions](https://www.kingston.com/en/community/articledetail/articleid/48543 "Traditional to Modern / Future Proof Storage solutions") for your workstation or corporate environment. NVMe technology is available in a number of form factors such as the PCIe card slot, M.2, and U.2. While there are SSDs that use the SATA, PCIe slot and M.2 that are AHCI (Advanced Host Controller Interface) and not NVMe, U.2 is a form factor that exclusively uses the NVMe protocol. The infographic in the above hyperlink will help you understand how all of the different form factors and protocols are found in various types of SSDs and what the differences are in performance. Check if your motherboard and chipset support the storage component upgrade with BIOS modifications (in rare cases). [Search and Compare PC Storage Solutions](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/internal-hard-drive/#sort=-formfactor&page=1 "Search and Compare PC Storage Solutions by PCPartPicker.com") and other components. A good setup requires a strong Antivirus Program that defends your data and hardware along with internet security. There are lots of programs that are available to choose from. Windows 10 Pro N Version comes pre-installed with [Microsoft Windows Security / Windows Defender](https://community.windows.com/en-us/videos/windows-security-the-dashboard-for-device-protections/e_Z2bk7Cp1g?from=WindowsSecurityApp-Home&OCID=WSHOME "Microsoft Windows Security / Windows Defender"). But I recommend coupling it with [ESET Smart Security Premium for Consumers](https://www.eset.com/in/home/unilicense/ "ESET Smart Security Premium Licensing - Consumer - Retail") or visit [ESET Business Cyber Security Suite Offerings](https://www.eset.com/in/business/portfolio/ "ESET Cyber Security Solutions for Business").

## Think Sustainable

Newer Hardware Components do affect your power consumption that can make it performance ready but at the same time _not let it affect the environment you and I truly require to be sustainable for our future generations._ You can always replace your existing hardware by checking the component compatibility at [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ "PCPartPicker") or start a New System Build via one of their available guides called [Build Guides](https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/ "Build Guides"). Each Hardware Component Manufacturer has an E-Waste Management Program designed specifically for our ecosystem. It ranges from [recycling responsibly, cut down air, water, and land pollution, thus contributing towards a clean and green environment.]() In fact, speaking of Retail E-Waste Management, e-commerce giants apart from manufacturers that provide the very same technology that allows you, the user, the power of information at your fingertips via company guidelines that have been set in place which allow the customer to recycle in India and around the globe.

## Securing Your Router

Your current Internet Service Provider has configured your Router, Network Switch (in Corporate and Retail Environments offered by technology giants like [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about.html "Cisco"), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ "Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company or International Business Machines (IBM)"), [Dell](https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-us/newsroom.htm#/filter-on/Country:en-us "Newsroom | Dell Technologies")) with the latest firmware which in my case (AS55836) auto upgrades itself to bridge the gap of security breach over wired or wireless connections. In my case, I prefer **Internet Infrastructure in Mumbai, INDIA - Jio Giga Fiber Router offered by Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited** (AS55836) registered with **Asia-Pacific Network Information Center**. To further customize your networking experience - Login to your ISP Provided Network Router by entering 192.168.29.1 without https:// or https:// - Enter Default username - admin / Password - Provided to you at the bottom of your router / Contact your System Administrator. Once logged in Navigate to **Web Management** and **Block LMUI from WiFi** (You need a Desktop PC to connect via the above Router IP - **Enabling this option will disable access via Laptop over WiFi or Mobile device over WiFi Connected Network**).

A small step to secure router, a secure IP and safe haven for your privacy that matters you may use 1.1.1.1 DNS or Domain Name Servers. Configure your Router as follows - Login to your **Router offered by Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited** (AS55836) registered with **Asia-Pacific Network Information Center as mentioned above as you might have been logged out due to inactivity of 03 minutes. Navigate to SECURITY (on the left navigation corner of your router dashboard) - Select FIREWALL -** IPv4 Firewall Rules and Add the following configuration - [**1.1.1.1 DNS**](https://1.1.1.1/dns/ "1.1.1.1 DNS - Privacy First: Guaranteed") / [**DNS Performance Analytics and Comparison **](https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers "DNS Performance Analytics and Comparison")

Some changes are irreversible and can cause loss of data, connectivity and security breaches.

## Secure Your Workstation

Hardware / Software Companies offer Annual Maintenance Services similar to a company insuring you from damage. It is important to invest in Thermal Solutions that keep the Chipset under optimum temperatures after a squeaky clean hardware device that runs above average temperatures which can cause permanent damage and financial losses.

## Thermal Cooling solutions

Do note that pre-built computers and laptops via manufacturers come bundled with Thermal Cooling solutions / Software Applications that keep the chipset temperatures under control but recovering older generation Desktop / Laptop Chipsets require a [thermal compound and thermal pads](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/thermal-paste/ "PCPartPicker") placed carefully on the chipset and your graphics card or GPU. It is a _strict no-no for trying out this on newer models under AMC Contracts or Warranty Period - Understand the "Can Void your Warranty" Disclaimer_ (Follow the Links below mentioning AMD®/Intel®/[Asus](https://www.asus.com/About-ASUS-History/ "Asus History")®/[Micro-Star International Co. or MSI](https://ruggedtablet.msi.com/ "MSI")® via [CineBench](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/products/cinebench-r20-overview/ "Cinebench R20 - Maxon")®). Apart from this, you would need some technical expertise as well and we are not just talking about a Phillips-Head screw and screwdriver (named after Henry Frank Phillips), a few screws and overclocking.

## Overclocking

## ISP Network Wars - Fiber Optic over CAT5/6/7 Cable Providers

Even though ISPs that provide you; the user, Internet over CAT5/6/7 cables which can give you a substantial amount of speed, it is important to note that fiber optic is less clutter in terms of wiring, installation and requires in-depth tech stack requirements, hence limited availability and provides better stability in terms of connectivity. This does not mean we should stop using CAT5/6/7 cables, instead switch over to better-infrared IP Camera Systems via Cloud Service Providers that do not make the hardware and cabling obsolete ready for recycling. Just pure simple better integration over a secured network that logs data via Cloud.

## Networking Router to Desktop / Laptop Integration (Wired)

If you are planning on using a wired connection to access the internet via your ISP provided router or more advanced router with better compatibility or functionality - network speeds over TCP/IP Protocols you can connect your router to your desktop or laptop workstation via a CAT7 for smaller cable lengths.

You can use these to transfer data over a secured network within a home/organization/host a micro instance of a website/blog. [Synology](https://www.synology.com/en-global "Synology Inc.") provides that infrastructure for small scale homeowners looking to backup data for RAID Devices / Redundancy purposes to Large scale enterprises looking to host a complex data storage service for its employees or simply use it as a Video Surveillance System. View the detailed video by [f-stoppers.com](https://youtu.be/RGVPeB98zWI "How To Build A 10Gb/s Network/Server"). Do note, some of the Synology NAS devices do not come with hard drives attached in-built. You will need to purchase [external SSDs/hard drives](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/external-hard-drive/#sort=-interface "PCPartPicker External SSDs - Check for Compatibility with Synology NAS Devices"), Intel® [Ethernet Converged Network Adapter cards](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/wired-network-card/#sort=ports&page=1 "PCPartPicker - Choose A Wired Network Adapters") that support up to 1GbE  which will be installed as an external hardware component via PCI/e slots for this to work at maximum performance via CAT6/7 Cables along with a [Cisco® Network Switch](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/solutions/small-business/resource-center/networking/network-switch-what.html "Cisco® Network Switch"). To keep the NAS or Storage Attached Network (SAN) Device always connected to your Workstation you would need to invest in [Uninterrupted Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/ups/ "PCPartPicker - Uninterrupted Power Supply") (UPS - not to be confused with the logistics company) in case of loss of power shortages/power failure/power surge to the motherboard.

#### Accessing Pre-Releases or Prior Versions of Browser for Website Compatibility for certain Web Portals

For example, if you wish to view a website that is Best viewed at : 1024x768, IE 7, Firefox 3.6.3 - In your internet browser IE 7, Firefox 3.6.3 - There is a high probability that you'd be using a browser version different from what is mentioned. In order to resolve this issue -

I am currently using **© Microsoft Windows Pro N - 10.0.18362 by Microsoft Corporation with System Type - x64-based PC** connected to a stable internet connection by my Internet Service Provider/s via an Ethernet Network Adapter Card, whilst downloading IE 7 (© Microsoft 2020 Windows Internet Explorer 7) it automatically reads your system information and reflects the **stable release under GNU License**.

**Download IE 7** (© Microsoft 2020 Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows 64 bit Client/Server) - https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/Download/confirmation.aspx?id=8356

**Download Firefox 3.6.3** (Portions of this content are ©1998–2020 by individual mozilla.org contributors) - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/ - Scroll down to 3.6 > Download the Firefox Official Release from 3.6.3.

Alternatively, you can get the direct link to read and understand the [Mozilla Firefox - Internet Browser **Release Notes **](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/3.6.3/releasenotes/ "Mozilla Firefox - Internet Browser Release Notes")

## Adobe Acrobat Pro DC

#### Using **Adobe Acrobat Pro 10** to Validate and Highlight User to Fill in Missing Data and Proceed with Validation, Provide a Signature for Authenticity via Certificate-based signatures.

Some governmental organizations instruct their applicants to use **Adobe Acrobat Pro 10 or higher** to fill the required electronic application form, digitally sign and verify that all data submitted via the encrypted .PDF is handled securely and transferred over to its network for review and processing. Once all important details are filled in you will be instructed to click on "**Validate**" Button for Authorisation and add data to their cloud/barebone data processing unit. If the form is validated, a page of barcode/s will be created, depending on the site architecture and build which can then be uploaded in your account dashboard whilst applying to their services/procuring goods. _This helps the environment as it is a sustainable approach to saving paper and ink whilst streamlining the entire process from the individual user to the processor_ (organization). Some organizations instruct the applicant to NOT use the “_signature panel_” button at the top of the application if instructed. To understand how you can provide a signature you can read an extensive set of articles uploaded on the [**Adobe User Guide/Help Section - Certificate-based signatures**](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/acrobat/using/certificate-based-signatures.html "Adobe User Guide/Help Section - Certificate-based signatures").

If you run into errors whilst doing so, you may print the "validated" application on white, bond-quality ("_not bond paper_"), non-glossy paper. These are just some of the recommendations on how to achieve "best results". Use a [laser printer](https://www.encyclopedia.com/computing/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/laser-printer 'JOHN DAINTITH "laser printer ." A Dictionary of Computing . .
