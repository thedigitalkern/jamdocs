## Build a Custom Desktop Computer . Workstation and Understanding Computer Specifications

This documentation is intended for viewers of [The Digital Kern - thedigitalkern.com](thedigitalkern.com "The Digital Kern"), built to spin up quick, beautiful and high performance custom machines without hassle, first, then follow along the journey to building websites for small to medium scale businesses.

This Documentation Guide is intended that you have basic knowledge of how a computer works with basic knowledge of [Operating System - Windows by Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/get-windows-10 "Operating System - Windows by Microsoft")®, [Microsoft](https://www.britannica.com/technology/MS-DOS "Microsoft Disk Operating System or MS-DOS")®[ Disk Operating System or MS-DOS](https://www.britannica.com/technology/MS-DOS "Microsoft Disk Operating System or MS-DOS") or [Windows Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7 "Windows Powershell") Commands required ([.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework ".NET Framework")), an active internet connection with substantial amount of bandwidth provided by your choice of Internet Service Provider or ISP, latest drivers pre-installed with your workstation provided by the Manufacturer or use [DriversCloud.com](https://www.driverscloud.com/ "DriversCloud.com") for fetching drivers automatically from digitally signed manufacturer websites or via third party sources offered at DriversCloud.com. 

## Updating Drivers and System Restore Point

The reason I recommend DriversCloud.com is because it allows the user to set a [System Restore Point](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point "System Restore Point") on your existing Operating System prior to making any changes to the system drivers. You can always opt out of the "change your default browser or allow it to add any further extensions to your browser apart from what is recommended upon setup. It is strongly advisable that you as a user check that you are running the latest version of [Windows 10 Pro N (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-is/p/windows-10-pro-n/dg7gmgf0dt06 "Windows 10 Pro N") that gives you the access approximately 85% of Random Access Memory or RAM. Also I find this resource quite useful on [How to Find Windows 10 Computer Specifications & Systems Requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/windows-10-specifications "How to Find Windows 10 Computer Specifications & Systems Requirements") before opting in to upgrading your existing Operating System and resolve any clarifications of whether your existing Hardware Components can or will support the upgrade. 

## Future Proofing does not only mean spending more, think of it more like an investment (*subject to market risks)

You as a user need to keep in mind that choosing the right hardware is quite important - [Future Proofing Hardware](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/future-proof-computer.htm "Future Proofing Hardware") - It is not always important to purchase the highest monetary value sorted in your search fields - You need to ask yourself this - Do I need this quality hardware / software update or upgrade consider it will solve the need or the purpose you intend to use it for? But having said that you'd need to keep in mind that investing in newer hardware technologies / software components / web servers / hard disk drives and other multi verse components will affect your system performance in turn your productivity. A simple check can be made via [Samsung's Official Website - Why it is important for you to invest in the latest Solid State Drives](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/pc-age-calculator/ "PC Age Calculator") as compared to older [Serial Advanced Technology Attachment or SATA](https://www.britannica.com/technology/SATA "Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA))") / Hard Disk Drives that perform at lower IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) or Read/Write Speeds during data transfer. 

## Should I or Should I Not? Thou shall Answer

The best way to approximate evaluate this is via a simple benchmark test on your existing hardware / software setup via [GeekBench.com by PRIMATE LABS](https://www.geekbench.com/ "GeekBench.com by PRIMATE LABS") - This service allows the user to evaluate mobile device / laptop or desktop computer performance and how it compares to the newest devices on the market.

## Think Sustainable

Newer Hardware Components do affect your power consumption that can make it performance ready but at the same time _not let it affect the environment you and I truly require to be sustainable for our future generations._ You can always replace your existing hardware by checking the component compatibility at [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ "PCPartPicker") or start a New System Build via one of their available guides called [Build Guides](https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/ "Build Guides"). Each Hardware Component Manufacturer has a E-Waste Management Program designed specifically for our ecosystem. It ranges from [recycling responsibly, cut down air, water and land pollution, thus contributing towards a clean and green environment.]() Infact, speaking of Retail E-Waste Management, e-commerce giants apart from manufacturers that provide the very same technology that allows you, the user, the power of information at your fingertips via company guidelines that have been set in place which allow the customer to recycle in India and around the globe.

## Securing Your Router

Your current Internet Service Provider has configured your Router, Network Switch (in Corporate and Retail Environments offered by technology giants like [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about.html "Cisco"), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ "Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company or International Business Machines (IBM)"), [Dell](https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-us/newsroom.htm#/filter-on/Country:en-us "Newsroom | Dell Technologies")) with the latest firmware which in my case (AS55836) auto upgrades itself to bridge the gap of security breach over wired or wireless connections. In my case, I prefer **Internet Infrastructure in Mumbai, INDIA - Jio Giga Fiber Router offered by Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited** (AS55836) registered with **Asia-Pacific Network Information Center**. To further customize your networking experience - Login to your ISP Provided Network Router by entering 192.168.29.1 without https:// or https:// - Enter Default username - admin / Password - Provided to you at the bottom of your router / Contact your System Administrator. Once logged in Navigate to **Web Management** and **Block LMUI from WiFi** (You need a Desktop PC to connect via the above Router IP - **Enabling this option will disable access via Laptop**). A small step to secure router, a secure IP and safe haven for your privacy that matters. Further you can Enable [DoS / DDoS Preventions](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/ddos/ "DoS / DDoS Preventions") via Security » Attack Checks » Dos / DDoS Preventions via the Admin Dashboard. This can cause serious damage even your local network. Enabling it is a smarter option. [Turning off Remote Desktop Connections via Windows OS](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2477133/remote-desktop-disconnected-or-can-t-connect-to-remote-computer-or-rem "Remote Desktop Connection via Windows OS") along with disabling [Intel® Virtualization Technology](https://www.intel.in/content/www/us/en/virtualization/virtualization-technology/intel-virtualization-technology.html "Intel® Virtualization Technology") offered by Intel when not required allows additional security. To [check if your hardware along with software meets the Intel® Virtualization Technology requirements](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/support/articles/000005486/processors.html " Intel® Virtualization Technology") you need to refer to this quick support guide. You need to enable it via BIOS as well. Do note that making changes to Hardware / Software / Drivers / BIOS / Networking Devices / Mobile Devices can cause critical damage and must require a professional with prior experience. Some changes are irreversible and can cause loss of data, connectivity and security breaches. 

## Secure Your Workstation

Hardware / Software Companies offer Annual Maintenance Services similar to a company insuring you from damage. It is important to invest in Thermal Solutions that keep the Chipset under optimum temperatures after a squeaky clean hardware device that runs above average temperatures which can cause permanent damage and financial losses. 

## Thermal Cooling solutions

Do note that pre-built computers and laptops via manufacturers come bundled with Thermal Cooling solutions / Software Applications that keep the chipset temperatures under control but recovering older generation Desktop / Laptop Chipsets require a [thermal compound and thermal pads](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/thermal-paste/ "PCPartPicker") placed carefully on the chipset and your graphics card or GPU. It is a _strict no-no for trying out this on newer models under AMC Contracts or Warranty Period - Understand the "Can Void your Warranty" Disclaimer_ (Follow the Links below mentioning AMD®/Intel®/[Asus](https://www.asus.com/About-ASUS-History/ "Asus History")®/[Micro-Star International Co. or MSI](https://ruggedtablet.msi.com/ "MSI")® via [CineBench](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/products/cinebench-r20-overview/ "Cinebench R20 - Maxon")®). Apart from this you would need some technical expertise as well and we are not just talking about a Phillips-Head screw and screwdriver (named after Henry Frank Phillips), a few screws and overclocking 

## Overclocking

Your AMD® [Chipsets](https://youtu.be/dXq7TqvTOj0 "AMD RYZEN Overclocking GUIDE") / Intel® [Chipsets](https://youtu.be/AxaIZgzTbMA "Should You Undervolt Your CPU?") and [GPUs](https://youtu.be/oZlmI-bxmXQ "Graphics Card Overclocking Guide!") via an Australia based YouTube Influencer - [Optimum Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYOj4DmyxhBVrdvbsUwmAA/featured "Optimum Tech"). Some manufacturers place hardware components carefully under the keyboard and some chipsets that require additional cooling which are placed reversed to distribute heat evenly.

## Local installation

Even though Jamdocs is so simple, you dont really need to set it up localy (you could just fork it on github to edit styles and md-files) - if you want to change it up a bit I recommend setting up localy for a better developer experience.

To set up a new instance of Jamdocs, and start developing just clone the project from Github like, go to the directory and run gridsome:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelhorn/jamdocs project-name
cd project-name
gridsome develop
```
