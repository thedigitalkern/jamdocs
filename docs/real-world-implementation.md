You do not require Cloudflare CDN or Content Delivery Network for this.

**Option 2** - If you already own a license to an older version of Adobe InDesign/Pagemaker/CorelDraw and would not like to upgrade. Installing the Issuu.com + InDesign Extension for Collaborate (Indesign CC 2014 10.0 and above)
