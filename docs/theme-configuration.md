## What is a .TLD / ccTLDs - Using Namemesh.com - Domain Name Generator

* Check availability of the [**most common TLDs**](https://www.namemesh.com/ "Namemesh.com - Domain Name Generator") including com, net, org. Also, checks the hyphenated version of your preferred domain name.
* Check domain availability of the **new gTLDs** that have been launched and have entered general availability. These TLDs include .email, .link, .domains and many more. New gTLDs are added as they are launched.
* Create **short domain names** by overlapping the keywords with the TLDs, like del.icio.us, foc.us, citi.es, etc.
* Check domain names with **some other popular TLDs** like co, io, it, mobi, name, me, ly and many more.

**Avoid the pop-ups (Great Tool though!)**  
Generate the **common alternatives for your domain name** by using the following methods -

* Thesaurus, Synonyms, Antonyms
* Real-World Intelligence
* Related words using collocations and n-grams
* over 6 million words database

Enter **special characters** to specify preferences and different generation methods

* Use __*__ to make sure the word is always included in the generated domain name.

  **Usage**: 'cool* domain' will generate words containing 'cool' and replacing domain with other similarly related words.
* Use **?** to replace a character with any letter or number.

  **Usage**: '???' will be replaced by all 3 letter dictionary words. You can also specify part of the word like p??? (for 4 letter words starting with 'p') and ???t (for 4 letter words ending with t).

Preserve the **main keywords entered in the final domain name and use the following to preserve SEO**

* Short Prefixes - uses popular prefixes
* Dictionary Prefixes and Suffixes - uses popular dictionary prefixes and suffixes
* Derived Words - similar words using the keywords as a root word
* Use __*__ with some letters to use dictionary words containing those letters. Eg: *z

Use various techniques to **smartly modify existing keywords to generate new words** that are very brandable. Some of the popular techniques used are

* Merged Portmanteau - also known as blending or meshing words is the most popular way of creating highly brandable names.
* Misspellings
* Phonetic Variations
* Short URL
* Overlapping
* Acronyms
* **Generate domains by mixing in other words and popular suffixes** like ly, ify etc. Some of the methods used are
  * Mix words
  * Simple Portmanteau - smartly merge popular suffixes like ly, ify, er, ish, ism and many more
  * Prefixes - use prefixes overlapping with the keywords
  * Suffixes - use suffixes overlapping with the keywords

## Whitelisting Safe Domains

[Whitelisting](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/bi-cloud/bilpd/whitelisting-safe-domains.html "Whitelisting Safe Domains - Preparing Data in Oracle Business Intelligence Cloud Service") allows or approves access to specific content. For security reasons, you’re not allowed to add external content to reports or embed your reports in other applications unless your administrator considers it safe to do so. Only administrators can add safe domains to the whitelist.

## Email Security & Privacy

**Security Tips** - [Trace an email with its full headers](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/29436?hl=en "Trace an email with its full headers") - For an email, you received in Gmail, you can see where the email came from by looking at its headers, including how it got from the sender to the recipient's mail servers. You need to enable the below-listed services with your existing custom email provider -

* [Sender Policy Framework](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/adminconsole/spf-configuration.html "Sender Policy Framework") - Sender Policy Framework/ SPF Records is a type of DNS record published in the domain's DNS that identifies the email servers that are permitted to send emails using the particular domain name. The main purpose of SPF records is to help the recipient email server identify the spam emails, sent using your domain name by spoofing/ forging the From email addresses. The purpose of an SPF record is to detect and prevent spammers from sending messages with forged From addresses on your domain. The SPF protocol is one of the standard validations to fight against spam. Additionally, it is also a part of [DMARC or Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/adminconsole/dmarc-policy.html "DMARC or Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance") specification.
* [DKIM - DomainKeys Identified Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/adminconsole/dkim-configuration.html "DKIM - DomainKeys Identified Mail") - DKIM is an authentication method, which uses [email encryption](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/email-encryption.html) with public/ private keys, to validate whether the emails are generated from the authorized servers, recognized and configured by the administrators of the sending domains.
* [Email Spoofing](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/adminconsole/dkim-configuration.html "Email Spoofing - ZohoMail") - Email spoofing is a cheating method used by spammers to make emails appear to be sent from a legitimate domain/ email address, that does not belong to them. This is done by forging the email headers, to make it seem legit so that the recipients trust and open the emails. Spammers follow this approach as it makes more people view the email since the sender appears to be authentic. But, sometimes, it may pose serious consequences if they try to retrieve sensitive information from the user. Spoofed emails can be detected and avoided by configuring SPF and DKIM. If DKIM is configured, the domain name identity associated with each message is validated. If this DKIM validation fails, such emails are quarantined or rejected based on the conditions set by you when DKIM validation fails.
* [Email Backscattering](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/adminconsole/dkim-configuration.html "Email Backscattering - ZohoMail") - Spammers spoof a domain name and send emails using the tampered email address. If the recipient domain rejects the email, it will send bounce messages to the domain that was spoofed. Consider a case where a spammer has spoofed your email address and sent spam emails to another domain. When these spam emails are sent to invalid email addresses, the recipient domain sends a bounce message to the spoofed domain. This bounce message, instead of being sent to the spammer will be sent to the spoofed domain from which the user is claiming to send the email. The spoofed domain will also be blacklisted by the recipient domain. If DKIM is configured, the authenticity of your domain can be validated and your domain blacklisting can be avoided. In case you're on the receiving end of these spam emails, DKIM can help detect the authenticity of the emails, and those emails that are not genuine will not be delivered to your mailbox. Email spoofing and backscattering, two methods that are commonly used by spammers, can be prevented to a certain extent by configuring SPF and DKIM for your domain.
