## What is a .TLD / ccTLDs - Using Namemesh.com - Domain Name Generator

* Check availability of the [**most common tlds**](https://www.namemesh.com/ "Namemesh.com - Domain Name Generator") including com, net, org. Also, checks the hyphenated version of your preferred domain name.
* Check domain availability of the **new gtlds** that have been launched and have entered general availability. These tlds include .email, .link, .domains and many more. New gtlds are added as they are launched.
* Create **short domain names** by overlapping the keywords with the tlds, like del.icio.us, foc.us, citi.es etc.
* Check domain names with **some other popular tlds** like co, io, it, mobi, name, me, ly and many more.

**Avoid the pop-ups (Great Tool though!)**  
Generate the **common alternatives for your domain name** by using the following methods -

* Thesaurus, Synonyms, Antonyms
* Real World Intelligence
* Related words using collocations and n-grams
* over 6 million words database

Enter **special characters** to specify preferences and different generation methods

* Use __*__ to make sure the word is always included in the generated domain name.

  **Usage**: 'cool* domain' will generate words containing 'cool' and replacing domain with other similarly related words.
* Use **?** to replace a character with any letter or number.

  **Usage** : '???' will be replaced by all 3 letter dictionary words. You can also specify part of the word like p??? (for 4 letter words starting with 'p') and ???t (for 4 letter words ending with t).

Preserve the **main keywords entered in the final domain name and use the following to preserve SEO**

* Short Prefixes - uses popular prefixes
* Dictionary Prefixes and Suffixes - uses popular dictionary prefixes and suffixes
* Derived Words - similar words using the keywords as a root word
* Use __*__ with some letters to use dictionary words containing those letters. Eg: *z

Use various techniques to **smartly modify existing keywords to generate new words** that are very brandable. Some of the popular techniques used are

* Merged Portmanteau - also known as blending or meshing words is the most popular way of creating highly brandable names.
* Misspellings
* Phonetic Variations
* Short URL
* Overlapping
* Acronyms
* **Generate domains by mixing in other words and popular suffixes** like ly, ify etc. Some of the methods used are
  * Mix words
  * Simple Portmanteau - smartly merge popular suffixes like ly, ify, er, ish, ism and many more
  * Prefixes - use prefixes overlapping with the keywords
  * Suffixes - use suffixes overlapping with the keywords
