## Photography Tripod Recommendations

* [**Manfrotto**](https://www.manfrotto.com/in-en/ "Manfrotto") manufactures Photography/Video Tripod based on **Key Features** such as -
  * **Material Used** - Carbon Fiber, Aluminium Alloy, Magnesium, Rubber, Steel, Technopolymer, Zamak and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) Plastic
  * **Load Capacity** - Maximum Weight Capacity
  * Maximum and Minimum **Height**
  * **Folded Length** for Portability
* **Traditional Tripods vs Modern Day Tripods** - Tripod ‘strength’ we’re essentially talking about stiffness (stiffness is measured in gigapascals (GPa) - One gigapascal (GPa) is equal to exactly one billion pascals. A pascal (Pa) is the SI unit for pressure define as one newton per square meter. 1 GPa = 1,000,000,000 Pa.) – resistance to compression when a load is placed on top.
* Some of the tripod manufacturers allow you to **swap out the standard feet for the included spikes or wide rubber feet** to accommodate different terrains and surfaces.
* [**Carbon Fiber Tripod**](https://www.manfrotto.com/in-en/shop-by/photographic-style/commercial/carbon_fiber/ "Manfrotto Carbon Fiber Tripods and Accessories") - stronger and lighter than their metallic counterparts - carbon fiber is much stronger, and because the material is less dense, it’s far lighter too. manufactured in a highly technical process, and mixed with a resin to give it its shape, there are different grades of quality. leg tubes that are made of carbon fiber; joins between leg sections and the head assembly still require metal components, meaning a typical weight saving of around 20-30% over an aluminum model. A composite material, strings of carbon atoms are set in a plastic resin, and have a very high strength-to-weight ratio, meaning that tripods made from the material are much lighter to carry. However, while tougher than aluminum, if it suffers from a sudden impact its greater rigidity means it’s prone to cracking or shattering.
* [**Aluminum**](https://www.manfrotto.com/in-en/shop-by/photographic-style/commercial/ "Manfrotto Aluminum Tripods and Accessories") - created from an aluminum alloy, and while not the strongest metal available, it is relatively strong for its weight. It also has the benefit of being fairly malleable, meaning that if you manage to damage it via impact, it will more likely become bent rather than completely broken, and therefore still be usable.
* **Tripod Heads for Still Photography Recommendations**
  * **Types Include** - 3 Way Head, Ball Heads, Pan & Tilt Heads, Tilt Heads, Geared Heads, Gimbal Heads, and Pistol Grip Heads
  * **Features** include **lightweight magnesium** options as well as **hydrostatic** and **built-in grip** types. Each Tripod Head serves a **Specific Purpose** for productivity (QR or **quick release system**) and **Usage** (For Video - Type of Shot - Pan, Smoothness, etc.)

**Tether shooting via Cable for Medium Format Cameras -**

Each Camera System is designed differently and hence the way to Tether Shoot direct to your newly built workstation requires Cables for High Data Transfer Speeds / Sync of Large .RAW / .NEF / and Camera Native File Formats

* [**Hasselblad**](https://www.hasselblad.com/ "Hasselblad - Medium Format Camera System") - **3FR (Hasselblad 3F RAW)** is a raw image format used by some Hasselblad digital cameras. Electronic File Formats Cameras and Digital Image Sensors Hasselblad 3FR. **Extension .3fr** - MIME Type(s) - **image/x-hasselblad-3fr** - **Hasselblad FireWire 800 Cable** for H3D, H4D and CFV - Backs to a computer's [FireWire](https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=firewire+card&N=100160874&name=Add-On%20Cards "PCPartPicker - FireWire Cards PCIe Slot") (IEEE 1394) port for tethered shooting or firmware updating.
* [**PhaseOne**](https://help.phaseone.com/en/CO12/Tethered-Capture/Tethered-Shooting-Overview "PhaseOne - Medium Format Camera System") **- IIQ RAW S and IIQ RAW L** - Phase One digital back users can choose between storing their tethered captures in two different types of compressed RAW files. (The format for the captures can be set using the Camera tool in the Capture tab).

  IIQ RAW stands for Intelligent Image Quality RAW. It is an intelligent way of turning the full 16-bit image data captured by the camera into a compact RAW file format.

  The IIQ Large RAW format is unique because it is completely lossless. IIQ RAW Large can be processed into a 16 bit TIFF, even though it is only half the size of a traditional RAW file. The IIQ Small RAW format is based on the full 16-bit data that is captured by the digital back’s CCD. However, unlike IIQ RAW Large, it is not 100% lossless. Most users will not notice any quality difference between the two file formats especially if the IIQ RAW Small format capture is well exposed and set on a low ISO rating.

## Image / File File Formats

* Output to **JPEG** is short for Joint Photographic Experts Group. It is a compressed format that in definition is a lossy-format, which means you lose some of the original information in the image file but benefit by having a much smaller file than TIFF or RAW.
* The **JPEG QuickProof™** format option creates images for evaluation purposes. Capture One creates the image file from the proxy file and the settings file without additional calculations or filters. JPEG QuickProof should not be considered as a completed file; it is ideal for ultra-quick evaluation purposes only.
* **JPEG XR** (e**X**tended **R**ange) delivers high-resolution files. It is a larger file size than a standard JPEG and supports lossless and lossy compression. It supports improved color accuracy with 16 bits per channel for a 48-bit image.
* **JPEG 2000** is, in essence, an improved file format standard that was developed with the aim to superseding the original JPEG in the year 2000. It delivers better compression of images by up to 20% according to the [Joint Photographic Experts Group.](https://www.jpeg.org "Joint Photographic Experts Group")
* **TIFF** stands for Tagged Image File Format. It is a popular lossless format that provides high color depth. A TIFF is larger than a JPEG but is ideal to preserve maximum quality. A TIFF also enables the option of 16-bit output per channel.
* The **DNG** (Digital Negative) format in Capture One, in essence, creates a new RAW file. There are no options for size or compression with this format. Alterations made in Capture One to the metadata and original (As Shot) White Balance will be saved – this does not affect image quality. All other changes made to an image will be discarded when creating the DNG file.
* **PNG** stands for Portable Network Graphics and employs lossless data compression. PNG is commonly associated with Internet usage. It does not support color spaces such as CMYK. A PSD (Photoshop Document) is fully compatible with imaging editing procedures in Photoshop.
* A **PSD** file (Adobe Photoshop Document) output using Capture One is, in essence, a flattened image file and has no adjustments layers that have been applied in the Local Adjustments tool tab.

**Tip**: Please check file format compatibility with other software solutions. It is worth noting that many image editing programs will need a plug-in to support different formats such as JPEG XR and JPEG 2000.
