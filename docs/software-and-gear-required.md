* **Photography Tripod Recommendations**
  * **Manfrotto** manufactures Photography/Video Tripod based on **Key Features** such as - [https://www.manfrotto.com/in-en/](https://www.manfrotto.com/in-en/ "https://www.manfrotto.com/in-en/")
    * **Material Used** - Carbon Fiber, Aluminium Alloy, Magnesium, Rubber, Steel, Technopolymer, Zamak and ABS Plastic
    * **Load Capacity** - Maximum Weight Capacity
    * Maximum and Minimum **Height**
    * **Folded Length** for Portability.
  * **Traditional Tripods vs Modern Day Tripods** - Tripod ‘strength’ we’re essentially talking about stiffness (stiffness is measured in gigapascals (GPa) - One gigapascal (GPa) is equal to exactly one billion pascals. A pascal (Pa) is the SI unit for pressure define as one newton per square meter. 1 GPa = 1,000,000,000 Pa.) – resistance to compression when a load is placed on top.
  * Some of the tripod manufacturers allow you to **swap out the standard feet for the included spikes or wide rubber feet** to accommodate different terrains and surfaces.
  * **Carbon Fiber Tripod** - stronger and lighter than their metallic counterparts - carbon fiber is much stronger, and because the material is less dense, it’s far lighter too. manufactured in a highly technical process, and mixed with a resin to give it its shape, there are different grades of quality. leg tubes that are made of carbon fiber; joins between leg sections and the head assembly still require metal components, meaning a typical weight saving of around 20-30% over an aluminum model. A composite material, strings of carbon atoms are set in a plastic resin, and have a very high strength-to-weight ratio, meaning that tripods made from the material are much lighter to carry. However, while tougher than aluminum, if it suffers from a sudden impact its greater rigidity means it’s prone to cracking or shattering.
  * **Aluminum** - created from an aluminum alloy, and while not the strongest metal available, it is relatively strong for its weight. It also has the benefit of being fairly malleable, meaning that if you manage to damage it via impact, it will more likely become bent rather than completely broken, and therefore still be usable.
* **Tripod Heads for Still Photography Recommendations**
  * **Types Include** - 3 Way Head, Ball Heads, Pan & Tilt Heads, Tilt Heads, Geared Heads, Gimbal Heads, and Pistol Grip Heads
  * **Features** include **lightweight magnesium** options as well as **hydrostatic** and **built-in grip** types. Each Tripod Head serves a **Specific Purpose** for productivity (QR or **quick release system**) and **Usage** (For Video - Type of Shot - Pan, Smoothness, etc.)
