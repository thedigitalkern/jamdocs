## 360° View Product Photography Table Tops

**Syrp Genie Turntable Kits** - [https://syrp.co/global/](https://syrp.co/global/ "Syrp Global") - Rotate objects and automate your product shoots with precision and repeatability. Dramatically improve your workflow and efficiency and create slick, smooth rotating product videos as well as interactive 360° images for online viewing. **Genie Slider Syrp Systems** - Video Capture and Editing for Product Shots to increase Sales - **Product Video Capture with Motion for Product Shots to increase Sales** via [Genie Slider Syrp Systems](https://syrp.co/global/ "Syrp.co Global Products") or [Purchase at BHPhotoVideo](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/Turntables-Panoramic-Stands/ci/6453/N/4075788768 "Purchase at BHPhotoVideo.com - Genie Syrp Systems") (Syrp Authorised Dealer)

Whilst investing in 360° View Product Table Tops you need to consider the following -

* Does the product you are planning on investing in, **shoot with precision** and **repeatable shoot smooth rotating video** and **create interactive 360° images of objects**?
* Does the manufacturer provide **iOS and Android App that accommodate both beginners through to experienced product users**?
* Does the **product offer battery life of 15hrs+ of time-lapse recording** and **up to 6hrs of video recording, all on a single charge**? What Voltage is required for it to work without issues **120 VAC / Multi-Voltage 120/240 / DC Voltage?**
* Does the product offer **Keyframe control, 360° Panorama recording and Pan and Tilt motion when combined with a second Genie Mini II or without the turntable attached**?
* Is it **compatible with a broad range of DSLRs, mirrorless cameras, and video cameras via an optional Shutter Link Cable which is required for time-lapse recording but not required for video**?
* My personal recommendation would be to go ahead with Genie Mini II - Product Turntable Kit (PB202000008) that includes (Product Turntable SY0025-0001) with (Genie Mini II - SY0033-0001) which connects with the Syrp Genie 2 App if you have used Syrp products before or would like to spend your reserve budget by investing in a Kit that has a payload (in terms of bearable physical weight capacity) of 8.8lbs (pounds) / 4kgs (kilograms).
* To understand whether to invest in this product, you must first understand if **it meets your minimum requirement such as space in your establishment, distance to depth perception to avoid distortion, additional accessories** (The Turntable Platform ships with a white and a black cardboard background disk - A downloadable template is available on Syrp's website for do-it-yourself mounting setups) and **connectivity options, cable management, battery replacement frequency, service options, warranty, and payload (weight capacity) that it can support along with product dimensions (turntable plate diameter)**. Get the Genie Mini II - Product Turntable Kit - BH #SYKIT0043 (B&H Kit) • MFR #SYKIT-0043

    * **Assets per section** 10 / 32 / 75 / 100 / 150 / 300
    * **Show custom fields** - Similar
* **Embed** - Embed this asset - By embedding this link you are acknowledging that it is accessible to anyone from where it is embedded.
  * **Asset CDN** Link - Add URL
